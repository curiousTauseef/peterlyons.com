# peterlyons.com web site

This repo contains a node.js/express.js web application I use to power my professional web site at [http://peterlyons.com]() and personal site at [http://peterlyons.org]()

[![Build Status](https://semaphoreci.com/api/v1/focusaurus/peterlyons-com/branches/develop/badge.svg)](https://semaphoreci.com/focusaurus/peterlyons-com)

![Technical Architecture Diagram](doc/peterlyons.com_technical_architecture_2014-12-21.png)
Basically, the site supports content in the following formats:

 - static html pages
 - pages written as [pug](https://pugjs.org) templates
 - pages written in [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
 - a basic blog engine
   - Includes an ATOM feed
   - Allows posts in HTML or markdown
   - contains some DSL magic HTML-ish tags to reduce boilerplate
   - has a handy output pipeline
 - a simple photo gallery system

Over the years, I've tried out various deployment methodologies and file layouts. I tried a full-on static site generator with all the generated files in the git repo, and have now decided I do not like that approach. Thus this site serves dynamic content primarily with tiny bits of caching at the few spots where we get decent bang for our caching buck.

## Heads Up

Currently [this npm v5.3 bug](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/17781) is breaking the build. Downgraded manually to v5.2 until a newer release fixes the prune operation.

## Related repositories

The site requires 3 git repositories to fully function

1. The code (this repository)
2. The data (blog posts and photo gallery metadata)
3. Static files (images, fonts, etc)

The data and static repositories aren't particularly interesting. All the interesting code is in this repository.

## How to Set Up for Development (OS X Scripted)

- run `./bin/install-prereqs.sh`

## How to Set Up for Development (Manual or custom)

- Install prereqs (homebrew is the recommended approach on OS X)
  - git
  - nvm
  - ansible (python virtualenv recommended)
  - vagrant
  - tar (included with OS X)
  - curl (included with OS X)
- Use nvm to install node
  - cd to repo root directory
  - `nvm install`
- `npm install`

## How to test

- `./bin/test-node.sh` to run the node tests
- `./bin/test-integration.sh` to run the integration tests

## How to Build

- do work in the develop branch
- when ready to cut a release candidate, get develop into a clean committed state
- make sure you are backmerged from master (normally this should always be true)
- run `./bin/release-candidate.sh <patch|minor|major>`
  - (patch is the default)*
- make sure the build and stage vagrant boxes are up with `vagrant up`
- create a build `./bin/build.sh <version>`
  - Normally `<version>` is the new git tag created
  - also supported is `WORK` to make a build out of files in your working directory
     - they must be at least added via `git add` but don't need to be committed
   - also supported is `HEAD` or any other git commit refspec
     - Any of these flavors will build using files from git exclusively regardless of the state of your working directory
- deploy that to the vagrant "stage" vm from your laptop via `./bin/deploy.sh build/<build>.tar.gz deploy/host-vagrant-stage.yml`
  - vagrant sudo password is `password`
- Test that and if all looks good you can finalize the release with

## How to Deploy

- `./bin/release.sh`
- deploy to prod with `./bin/deploy.sh build/<build>.tar.gz deploy/host-production.yml`
